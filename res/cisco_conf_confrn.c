/*
 * Cisco Confrn + Join + RmLastConf softkey machinery: bridge-modifying
 * conference operations. Compiled into res_pjsip_cisco_conference.so.
 *
 * Confrn (3-way build):
 *   The phone has two SIP dialogs at the moment Confrn is pressed —
 *   the active call (held during consult) and the consult call. We
 *   merge their remote-side legs plus the original phone-side leg
 *   into a fresh multimix bridge, then drive Cisco's UI transition
 *   via holdretrievereq + Cisco-flavoured in-dialog NOTIFY +
 *   connected-line update carrying the \2004 display token.
 *
 * Join (multi-call merge):
 *   For each previously-Selected dialog, UNHOLD its remote peer, move
 *   it into a new multimix conference, softhangup its phone-side
 *   anchor. The active call's phone-side becomes the conference
 *   anchor; cleanup is a single OOB Join notifyreq REFER.
 *
 * RmLastConf:
 *   Walks the per-channel join-time datastore (set by
 *   cisco_conf_mark_joined in cisco_session.c at every remote-leg
 *   ast_bridge_move) to find the participant with the latest
 *   timestamp, then ast_bridge_remove()s it.

 * Shared: pick the bridge's video routing mode.
 *
 * Asterisk's softmix bridge defaults to AST_BRIDGE_VIDEO_MODE_NONE,
 * which drops every video RTP frame between participants. With the
 * SMART flag on a multimix bridge that auto-promotes 2-party-native
 * -> 3-party-softmix during a Confrn or Join, that default kicks in
 * the moment the third channel joins — and the only-video-capable
 * participant's stream goes black on every other participant's
 * screen. Symptom observed live on 2026-05-15: door-camera video
 * disappeared from the 8865 the instant a mobile leg was Confrn'd
 * into the call.
 *
 * Pick the mode per actual participant capability:
 *
 *   exactly one video-capable channel
 *       -> SINGLE_SRC pinned to it. Right for the door-camera-into-
 *          audio-conference case: always forward the camera feed
 *          regardless of who's talking. Other participants without
 *          a screen (a SIP trunk to a mobile) get the frames and
 *          drop them harmlessly.
 *
 *   two or more video-capable channels
 *       -> TALKER_SRC. Bridge forwards whichever video participant
 *          is currently the active audio talker — the standard
 *          multi-party video-conference behaviour Cisco SX10 /
 *          Polycom RealPresence / etc use.
 *
 *   zero video-capable channels
 *       -> TALKER_SRC. Harmless (nothing to route either way) and
 *          keeps the bridge in a defined state if a video peer
 *          arrives later via a transfer/join.
 *
 * "Video-capable" is read off the channel's negotiated native
 * formats — set during the call's SDP exchange, stable by the time
 * we're forming the conference. ast_format_cap_has_type returns 1
 * if ANY video format is present, which correctly handles
 * sendonly-camera peers (door has video in its native formats even
 * though it won't accept video back) and rejects audio-only peers
 * (mobile/trunk with no h264 in its codec list).
 */
/*!

 * \brief Create a UAS dialog from the REFER's rdata, send the 202 Accepted

 *
 * Cisco firmware requires the follow-up Event:refer NOTIFY (the one that
 * transitions the phone's UI to "Conference" after Confrn succeeds) to be
 * in-dialog with the original REFER — i.e. share Call-ID + From/To tags.
 * An OOB NOTIFY against the contact URI is silently ignored. So instead
 * of going through cisco_send_refer_response (which is OOB-friendly and
 * adds Refer-Sub: false), we build the dialog ourselves and send the 202
 * inside it, leaving the implicit subscription open for the NOTIFY.
 *
 * Lifecycle bookkeeping is subtle — pjsip's inc_lock and inc_session both
 * touch sess_count, which makes mismatches silently disastrous:
 *
 *   pjsip_dlg_create_uas_and_inc_lock  — creates dlg, takes mutex, AND
 *     does an inc_lock side effect: sess_count goes 0 → 1.
 *   pjsip_dlg_dec_lock                  — releases mutex AND drops
 *     sess_count by 1. If sess_count hits 0 with no pending tsx, the
 *     dialog is destroyed inside dec_lock.
 *   pjsip_dlg_inc_session / dec_session — independent of the mutex;
 *     this is what we want for keeping a dialog alive across function
 *     returns.
 *
 * So on the success path we must add a real session ref before dec_lock,
 * otherwise sess_count goes 1 → 0 inside dec_lock and the dialog only
 * survives as long as the inbound REFER's UAS tsx keeps tsx_count > 0
 * — a race against the conference_send_task serializer.
 *
 * On the failure path we don't take that session ref, so dec_lock just
 * unwinds the inc_lock side effect and the dialog destroys naturally.
 *
 * \retval dlg with +1 session count held — caller must dec_session via
 *         conference_task_data_destroy.
 * \retval NULL on failure (already logged; nothing to release).
