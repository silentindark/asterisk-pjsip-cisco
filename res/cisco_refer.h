/*
 * Asterisk -- An open source telephony toolkit.
 *
 * Out-of-band Cisco RemoteCC REFER + multipart-body sending helpers
 * for the res_pjsip_cisco_* family.
 *
 * Cisco unsolicited REFERs (bulkupdate, HLog state push, MCID feedback,
 * ConfList menu) all share the same fan-out: walk every AOR on the
 * endpoint, fetch each AOR's registered contacts, build one REFER per
 * contact with a Content-ID-keyed body. The conference / park /
 * phone-initiated paths instead target a single contact (or the contact
 * resolved from the inbound rdata's source IP:port). Both shapes live
 * here.
 *
 * Lives separately from cisco_endpoint.h so modules that only deal with
 * sorcery / REGISTER-time supplements don't compile in the multipart
 * machinery — and so the multipart-add helper sits next to the REFER
 * sender that drives it.
 *
 * Bodies live in res/cisco_refer.c, compiled into
 * res_pjsip_cisco_endpoint.so; other cisco_* modules resolve the
 * symbols at load time.
 *
 * Depends on cisco_endpoint.h transitively (the helpers take
 * struct ast_sip_endpoint *), but does not require cisco_rdata.h.

 * ConfList menu) all share the same loop: walk every AOR on the
 * endpoint, fetch each AOR's registered contacts, build one REFER per
 * contact with a Content-ID-keyed body. Lift the scaffolding here so
 * the call sites collapse to: (1) define a ctx struct, (2) write a
 * one-line body-builder adapter, (3) call this helper.
 *
 * The per-iter log is uniform: "<prefix>: <subject> sent to <uri>".
 * If a caller wants additional context (endpoint_id, state flags) on
 * the success line, log it once before the helper call at the
 * task-start boundary.
