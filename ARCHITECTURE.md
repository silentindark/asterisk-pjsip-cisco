# Architecture

How and why these ten modules add up to working BLF for Cisco
Enterprise SIP firmware.

## The four-behaviour insight

Cisco firmware classifies a line button as **BLF Speed Dial** (hook
icon, lit/unlit LED, reacts to monitored extension state) versus
**plain Speed Dial** (keypad icon, no state) based on a combination
of **four independent server signals at REGISTER time and beyond**:

1. The phone's SEP `<featureID>21</featureID>` per button. (Existing
   provisioning — not our concern.)
2. The REGISTER 200 OK response carrying a Cisco RemoteCC
   **optionsind** body that explicitly advertises support:
   ```xml
   <presence usage="blf speed dial"><unot/><sub/></presence>
   ```
3. An unsolicited REFER carrying a multipart **bulkupdate** body
   with per-line config (`<contact line="N">…`).
4. **Unsolicited** Event: presence NOTIFYs from the server for each
   monitored extension. These are distinct from NOTIFYs the server
   sends in response to the phone's own SUBSCRIBE.

The non-obvious part is #4: Cisco firmware specifically distinguishes
between "NOTIFY in response to my SUBSCRIBE" (treated as background
BLF info, button stays plain Speed Dial) and "unsolicited NOTIFY from
server" (treated as server-managed BLF, button flips to BLF Speed Dial
mode). Same body content; different trigger.

If any of (2), (3), or (4) is missing, the firmware silently
downgrades the button display to keypad icon and ignores subsequent
state updates, even though it does send and accept SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY
on the wire.

```

## Module-by-module rationale

### res_pjsip_cisco_endpoint

Adds a parallel `cisco` sorcery type keyed by endpoint name, taking
advantage of PJSIP's same-name-different-type sections:

```
[1010]
type    = endpoint
...

[1010]
type    = cisco
...
```

This avoids needing to extend `struct ast_sip_endpoint` (which would
require patching Asterisk core). Existence of a `[name] type=cisco`
section is the gating signal for every other module.

`cisco_endpoint_get()` and the other shared `cisco_*` helpers are
declared in `res/cisco_endpoint.h` / `cisco_rdata.h` / `cisco_register.h`
/ `cisco_refer.h` / `cisco_session.h` / `cisco_orig_host.h` and defined
in their sibling `.c` files. All six `.c` files are compiled into
`res_pjsip_cisco_endpoint.so`, which carries `AST_MODFLAG_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS`
so its `cisco_*` exports (controlled by `res/res_pjsip_cisco_endpoint.exports`)
are visible to every other module at load time. Same pattern stock
`res_pjsip.so` uses to publish `ast_sip_*` to every PJSIP submodule.

This module also registers the global `PJSIP` presence-state
provider — the one a BLF hint reaches as `PJSIP:<endpoint>` in its
presence component (second comma-separated half), e.g.
`exten => 1010,hint,PJSIP/1010,PJSIP:1010`. The callback reads
`DND/<endpoint>` from astdb and returns `AST_PRESENCE_DND` /
`NOT_SET`; `cisco_dnd_set()` fires `ast_presence_state_changed` so
toggles propagate to live watchers. Mirrors the chan_sip
cisco-usecallmanager patch's `sip_presencestate`, but reachable from
an out-of-tree module: the colon form (not `PJSIP/1010`) is required
because core chan_pjsip's `ast_channel_tech` has no `.presencestate`
callback and this project doesn't patch core. Non-Cisco endpoints
report `NOT_SET` so the provider is inert for non-Cisco peers.

A third registration: `cisco_orig_host_register()` (from
`cisco_orig_host.c`) installs a global `pjsip_module` whose
`on_tx_request` callback rewrites Request-URI and To-URI host:port
back to the phone's self-advertised contact host whenever
`res_pjsip_nat` has left an `x-ast-orig-host` URI parameter on the
Contact-derived RURI (i.e. for a NAT'd registered contact). Without
this rewrite, Cisco Enterprise firmware (verified against
CP8861/14.1.1 and CP7975G/9.4.2) rejects unsolicited NOTIFYs and
unsolicited REFERs to its WAN-side contact with `400 Bad Request` —
the phone's own alarm payload echoes the rejected RURI verbatim, so
the firmware is matching on it. The hook fires after PJSIP has
selected the transport but before serialisation, so changing the
URIs only affects the wire bytes, not where they're routed (the
public TCP connection stays in use). Strict no-op when the URI has
no `x-ast-orig-host` parameter, so LAN-registered contacts and
trunk-bound traffic pass through untouched and no consumer module
opts in — sending an out-of-dialog request to a NAT'd Cisco-phone
contact is enough.

This means `res_pjsip_cisco_unsolicited_blf`'s presence NOTIFYs and
`res_pjsip_cisco_bulkupdate`'s REFERs (and any future Cisco-* module
that targets a NAT'd contact) all inherit the rewrite by simply
sending requests. The rewrite is wired structurally rather than
plumbed per-module.

### res_pjsip_cisco_pidf_body_generator

Two registrations under one `.so`:

- A **body supplement** for `application/pidf+xml` that augments
  stock `res_pjsip_pidf_body_generator`'s output. Stock builds the
  basic `<presence>/<note>/<tuple>/<status>` body; we add
  `<dm:person>/<e:activities>` with the RPID and Cisco-rpid
  elements. Pubsub runs supplements right after the generator (and
  before serialisation), so they share the same `pjpidf_pres` tree.
  Stock pidf and us coexist — no `noload`, no slot conflict.

- A **body generator** for `application/cpim-pidf+xml` (plus a
  matching supplement). Cisco firmware advertises only
  `cpim-pidf+xml` in its SUBSCRIBE Accept header; stock
  `res_pjsip_xpidf_body_generator` would respond with the older
  RFC 2779 XPIDF format which doesn't carry RPID. We hijack the
  subtype label and emit the same modern PIDF body (built via
  pjpidf the same way stock pidf does). Pubsub allows only one
  generator per content type, so we set `load_pri` lower than
  `AST_MODPRI_CHANNEL_DEPEND` to register first; stock xpidf logs
  one WARNING at startup ("already registered") and declines.

Net body shape on the wire:

```xml
<presence xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf"
          xmlns:dm="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:data-model"
          xmlns:e="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:status:rpid"
          xmlns:ce="urn:cisco:params:xml:ns:pidf:rpid"
          entity="sip:1004@host">
  <dm:person>
    <e:activities>
      <e:on-the-phone/>     <!-- INUSE | BUSY | ONHOLD -->
      <ce:alerting/>        <!-- RINGING (Cisco-only) -->
      <e:busy/>             <!-- BUSY -->
      <ce:dnd/>             <!-- DND (Cisco-only) -->
    </e:activities>
  </dm:person>
  <tuple id="1004">
    <status><basic>open|closed</basic></status>
  </tuple>
</presence>
```

Stock res_pjsip_pidf_body_generator emits only the `<tuple>` part —
the firmware accepts that body (200 OK) but doesn't recognise it as
BLF. With our supplement loaded the same body now also carries the
`<dm:person>/<e:activities>` block, which is what flips the
firmware's BLF parser.

### res_pjsip_cisco_register_optionsind

Hooks `on_tx_response` via `ast_sip_register_service` and attaches
`application/x-cisco-remotecc-response+xml` optionsind body to every
outgoing REGISTER 200 OK for endpoints flagged Cisco. Body shape
mirrors the chan_sip patch's
`channels/sip/response.c:276-310 sip_response_send_with_options_ind`.

Endpoint id is extracted from the To-header user part of the
response, then the cisco sorcery object is looked up.

### res_pjsip_cisco_bulkupdate

Hooks REGISTER via `ast_sip_supplement` and queues a deferred task
to send an unsolicited REFER. The REFER carries multipart
`application/x-cisco-remotecc-request+xml` with three parts:
`<dndupdate>`, `<hlogupdate>`, and `<bulkupdate><contact
line="N">…</contact>`.

Body shape mirrors chan_sip patch's
`channels/sip/peers.c:2824 sip_peer_send_bulk_update`.

The line index and DND busy behavior come from the cisco sorcery
object. DND, hunt-group, and call-forward state come from astdb, while
MWI counts come from endpoint/AOR mailbox configuration.

Note the deliberate two-channel split for DND: `dnd_busy` is a static
operator preference (reject calls vs ring silently when DND is on),
configured in `pjsip.conf` on the cisco sorcery object; the on/off
state itself lives at runtime in astdb (`DND/<endpoint>`) so a
dialplan feature code or the phone's softkey can toggle it without a
config reload.

The module also exposes `pjsip cisco bulkupdate <endpoint>` for
operators or dialplan/AMI tooling that mutates `DND/<endpoint>` or
`CF/<endpoint>` directly and wants to push the refreshed state without
waiting for the next REGISTER.

### res_pjsip_cisco_unsolicited_blf

Same hooking pattern as bulkupdate. After REGISTER, walks the
endpoint's `subscribe = …` field from the cisco sorcery object and
sends an unsolicited Event: presence NOTIFY for each watched
extension. Body uses the same Cisco-flavoured PIDF as the
body-generator module (the build inlines that XML rather than
factoring it out — keeps each module self-contained and avoids
inter-module symbol exports).

This is the module that decisively flips the firmware into BLF
Speed Dial mode for the line buttons. Without it, the optionsind
body alone is necessary but not sufficient.

### res_pjsip_cisco_service_control

CLI commands that send manual unsolicited NOTIFYs for operational
purposes:

| Command | Event | Subscription-State | Body |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pjsip cisco check-sync <ep> [contact]` | `check-sync` | `terminated` | (none) |
| `pjsip cisco restart <ep> [contact]` | `service-control` | `active` | `action=restart` + `RegisterCallId={…}` + version stamps |
| `pjsip cisco reset <ep> [contact]` | `service-control` | `active` | `action=reset` + `RegisterCallId={…}` + version stamps |

Replaces chan_sip's `sip notify cisco-{check-cfg,restart,reset}`
templates from `sip_notify.conf`.

The `RegisterCallId` field is the Call-ID of the phone's own REGISTER
transaction; the firmware validates it and 400s a mismatch. It's read
per-contact from `contact->call_id` (the registrar records it on every
REGISTER), not from a single per-endpoint slot — a shared line
(`max_contacts > 1`) has several phones with distinct REGISTER
Call-IDs, and each NOTIFY must carry the Call-ID of the phone it's
addressed to. The version stamps are advisory and sent all-zero.

The optional `[contact]` is a substring matched against a registered
contact's URI or its `@hash`: present → only matching contacts get the
NOTIFY (restart one phone of a shared line); absent → every registered
contact. Both arguments tab-complete (endpoint = `type=cisco` object
ids; contact = the endpoint's registered contact URIs).

### res_pjsip_cisco_feature_events

Handles Cisco phone-originated DND / CFwdALL softkey signaling, in both
forms the firmware uses depending on the `<dndControl>` SEP setting:
`Event: as-feature-event` SUBSCRIBE (`application/x-as-feature-event+xml`)
and `Event: presence` PUBLISH (`application/pidf+xml` with a `<ce:dnd/>`
activity). Both handlers run after PJSIP authentication and before stock
pubsub, and write to the same astdb keys bulkupdate reads:
`DND/<endpoint>` and `CF/<endpoint>`. The PUBLISH path also registers a
`cisco_auth` endpoint identifier that matches the post-401 PUBLISH by its
`Authorization` digest username, since Cisco's PUBLISH carries the device
MAC (not the line id) in its From-URI and stock identifiers can't match
it.

The same module closes a related gap for device-level REFER (RemoteCC
token registration, alarm reports, RemoteCC responses) and some PUBLISH
traffic, which Cisco also sources from a `sip:<mac>@phone-ip` From-URI:
on every authenticated REGISTER from a Cisco endpoint it harvests the
device MAC out of the Contact header parameters (`+sip.instance`'s
urn:uuid node, `+u.sip!devicename.ccm.cisco.com="SEPxxxx"`, or a bare
12-hex value) into an in-memory `MAC -> {endpoint id, source IP, expiry}`
map, and a `cisco_mac` endpoint identifier resolves a later request whose
From-URI user is one of those MACs back to the endpoint — gated on the
request arriving from the same source IP the REGISTER did. That gets the
request past the distributor (it would otherwise be logged "No matching
endpoint found" and 401'd before `res_pjsip_cisco_remotecc` sees it);
whether it then survives auth depends on the firmware's REFER re-auth
behaviour.

### res_pjsip_cisco_remotecc

Handles Cisco phone-originated RemoteCC REFERs with proprietary
`application/x-cisco-remotecc-*` bodies. It accepts token registration,
alarm, remotecc-response, and x-cisco-location notifications. It also
parses `<softkeyeventmsg>` and implements HLog by toggling
`HuntGroup/<endpoint>` in astdb, then sending a `<hlogupdate>` REFER
back to registered contacts. MCID resolves the supplied `<dialogid>`
via PJSIP's native `pjsip_ua_find_dialog` (through the shared
`cisco_dialog_session_lookup` helper in `cisco_session.h`), queues
`AST_CONTROL_MCID` on the matched channel when the call is bridged,
and sends Cisco statusline/tone feedback REFERs.

**Park / ParkMonitor.** The softkey REFER carries `<dialogid>` for the
call to park; `handle_park` resolves it to the phone's channel + its
bridge peer (synchronously, so the REFER response is meaningful — `400`
malformed, `481` call gone/unbridged, `404` parkext not in dialplan,
`202` accepted), then queues a task on its own serializer
(`pjsip/cisco-park`) that blind-transfers the *peer* to `<parkext>@<the
parker's transfer context>` via `ast_bridge_transfer_blind()` — the
same path a plain "transfer to 700" takes, so `res_parking` owns slot
allocation, comeback-to-origin (from the `BLINDTRANSFER` var the blind
transfer sets) and tearing down the phone's leg. No bridge surgery and
no SIP-side work runs on the rx thread. `parkext` defaults to `700` and
is overridable per endpoint (`parkext=` on the `type=cisco` object);
the context is `TRANSFER_CONTEXT` chan var, else the endpoint's
configured context — matching stock `res_pjsip_refer`. Before the
transfer runs, the task re-checks the parker's current bridge peer
against the one captured at REFER time (a peer change in the meantime →
abort with feedback, don't park the wrong call). A subscription to
`ast_parking_topic()` (selective filter: `ast_parked_call_type()` +
`stasis_subscription_change_type()`) learns the slot and drives the
phone feedback: for `Park`, one `<statuslineupdatereq>` REFER toast
announcing the slot (then unsubscribe); for `ParkMonitor`, an
`Event: refer` / `application/dialog-info+xml` NOTIFY (Cisco's
`xmlns:call=…callinfo-dialog`, `<call:park><event>parked|retrieved|
forwarded|abandoned|error</event>`) on every parked-call
lifecycle event so a "Park slot N" line button tracks the orbit,
unsubscribing on the terminal event. Mirrors chan_sip's
`handle_remotecc_park` / `park_thread` / `remotecc_park_notify`, but
parks via the blessed transfer API rather than `chan_sip`'s
`sip_pvt`-internal park machinery.

Conference-related softkeys (Confrn / ConfList / Mute / Remove /
Update / Select / Unselect / Join) are claimed by
`res_pjsip_cisco_conference` at an earlier priority slot — see that
module's section below. `Cancel` is currently accepted as a no-op
(server-side cancel of an in-progress operation is not yet wired —
see the TODO in `handle_softkey_event`). Any other RemoteCC softkey
this module sees and doesn't recognise gets `603 Decline`. Claiming
those REFERs (rather than letting them fall through) is what stops
stock PJSIP REFER transfer handling from trying to process Cisco
RemoteCC bodies as ordinary call transfers.

### res_pjsip_cisco_call_extras

Adds Cisco-specific call signaling details to regular INVITE/UPDATE
traffic for Cisco endpoints. It appends `X-cisco-sis-10.0.0` to
`Supported`, sends `Call-Info:
<urn:x-cisco-remotecc:callinfo>;orientation=...;security=...`, carries
`CISCO_CALLBACK_NUMBER` as `x-cisco-callback-number` in
Remote-Party-ID, and adds the legacy H.264 video SDP hints
`b=TIAS:4000000` plus default `imageattr` when stock SDP has no
imageattr. `CISCO_HUNTPILOT` is also represented as `huntpiloturi` in
Call-Info for outbound calls to the phone.

### res_pjsip_cisco_conference

Cisco RemoteCC conference control. Hooks into the same incoming-REFER
stream as `res_pjsip_cisco_remotecc` but at a slot earlier in the
pjsip module priority chain (`PJSIP_MOD_PRIORITY_APPLICATION - 2`),
so it gets first crack at parsing the body. Claims the
conference-family softkey REFERs; everything else falls through to
`res_pjsip_cisco_remotecc` unchanged.

Resolves the XML `<dialogid>` on every REFER to an `ast_sip_session`
via the shared `cisco_dialog_session_lookup` helper (in
`cisco_session.h`, wrapping `pjsip_ua_find_dialog` +
`ast_sip_dialog_get_session`), independent of the remotecc dialog
registry — no cross-module symbol export needed.

**ConfList + participant-pick action softkeys.** When ConfList
arrives the module walks the channel's bridge with `ast_bridge_peers`
and sends an unsolicited REFER back to the phone with a
`<datapassthroughreq applicationid="1">` echo and a
`<CiscoIPPhoneMenu>` listing each peer's caller-id name. Body shapes
mirror chan_sip's `channels/sip/conference.c sip_conference_participants`.
Bridge-agnostic — works against any Asterisk bridge containing the
phone's channel, including `ConfBridge()`. Mute / Remove / Update /
participant-pick action softkeys land via the chan_sip-style two-step
state machine: a sticky softkey REFER sets the pending action, the
next participant-pick REFER applies it; default action when no
softkey was pressed first is Mute, matching the patch.

**Confrn** (build a 3-way conference from the active 2-party call) is
fully wired: holdretrieve REFER + Cisco-flavoured completion NOTIFY,
the connected-line "Conference" display token, the explicit
consult-anchor softhangup, and the `cisco_keep_conference` knob that
controls what happens when the initiator hangs up first.

**Select / Unselect / Join** (multi-call merge) — Select adds a
dialog to a per-endpoint selected-calls list, Unselect removes it,
Join (pressed on the active call) merges the active call's phone-side
plus each selected call's remote-side into a single multimix bridge
and softhangs the selected calls' phone-side anchors. Cleanup is a
single OOB REFER with `<notifyreq><feature>Join</feature>
<status>Complete</status>` targeting the active dialog.

`RmLastConf` (remove the most recently joined party from a conference)
is the named remaining gap — still deferred.

## Build system

`Makefile` (no autoconf — too much ceremony for ten modules). It can
source pjproject headers from `pkg-config`, an explicit
`PJPROJECT_INCLUDE`, or an Asterisk source tree via `PJPROJECT_DIR`.
When `PJPROJECT_DIR` is set, Asterisk headers are derived from that
same source tree so struct layouts match the running binary.

`AST_MODULE_SELF_SYM` is hand-derived per-module via Make's `$<`. The
linker script (`.exports` file) is the standard Asterisk one — every
symbol is local except `_IO_stdin_used` — so we don't have a
visibility fight on every Asterisk minor.

## XML documentation

Asterisk's strict sorcery validator demands a `<configObject>` match
in some `*-en_US.xml` file under `/var/lib/asterisk/documentation/`
before it'll accept field registrations. We extract every
`/*** DOCUMENTATION ... ***/` block from the source files into
`doc/res_pjsip_cisco-en_US.xml` at build time. `make install`
copies that to `$(ASTERISK_DOC_DIR)`.

## Wire format reference

For implementers porting to other UAs or maintaining over time, the
exact wire content of every server→phone message is captured in
`/* … */` block comments at the top of each module source file. The
chan_sip patch is the source of truth — every body shape here is
line-mapped back to a function in
`channels/sip/{request,response,peers}.c` of
[`cisco-usecallmanager`](https://usecallmanager.nz).

## What's deliberately NOT here

Known remaining feature gaps (RemoteCC softkeys whose Asterisk-side
integration hasn't been ported):

- **`RmLastConf`** — remove the most recently joined party from a
  conference. The rest of the conference family (Confrn, ConfList +
  action softkeys, Select / Unselect / Join) is implemented; this is
  the named remaining piece. Currently falls through to
  `res_pjsip_cisco_remotecc`'s `603 Decline`.
- **`Cancel` server-side cancellation** — the softkey is accepted
  (200 OK to the REFER) but the implied "cancel my in-progress
  operation on the server" hasn't been wired through. Tracked by the
  TODO at `handle_softkey_event` in `res_pjsip_cisco_remotecc.c`.

Each is additive — same supplement / register-service / pubsub
pattern as the existing modules; no redesign required when picked up.
